Understanding and predicting molecular responses in single cells upon chemical, genetic, or mechanical perturbations is a core question in biology. Obtaining single-cell measurements typically requires the cells to be destroyed. This makes learning heterogeneous perturbation responses challenging as we only observe *unpaired* distributions of perturbed or non-perturbed cells. Here we leverage the theory of optimal transport and the recent advent of convex neural architectures to present `CellOT`, a framework for learning the response of individual  cells to a given perturbation by coupling these unpaired distributions. We achieve this alignment with a learned transport map that allows us to infer the treatment responses of unseen untreated cells. `CellOT` outperforms current methods at predicting single-cell drug responses, as profiled by scRNA-seq and a multiplexed protein imaging technology.

This repository contains the `CellOT` method and evaluation scripts to reproduce the results of experiments on predicting single-cell drug responses, as profiled by scRNA-seq and a multiplexed protein imaging technology. Further, we provide experiments on `CellOT`'s generalization performance to unseen settings by (a) predicting the scRNA-seq responses of holdout lupus patients exposed to IFN-beta, and (b) modeling the hematopoietic developmental trajectories of different subpopulations.
